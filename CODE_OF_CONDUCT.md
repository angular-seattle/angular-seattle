# Angular Seattle's code of conduct:

Angular Seattle is an inclusive community. The lessons learned and the friendships made at our events continue throughout the entire year. We are a community of developers, designers, and entrepreneurs of all skill levels, genders, religions, and backgrounds. As a community we want everyone to feel welcome. A requirement that all participants must adhere to this goal and abide by the guidance in this document.

To help all feel welcome and safe, we ask you to approach each interaction with your fellow community members as an opportunity to help each other grow. Your words and silence, your actions and inactions. Each of these can affect the way those around you will feel. With that in mind, it is best to take a considerate and empathetic approach with all those you meet.

We do not tolerate verbal comments or presentation material that makes inappropriate use of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.

We require participants to respect others' boundaries and do not tolerate deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, disruption of sessions, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers will take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund or banned from participating in future events. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact any of the organizers.

## How to Report Harassment and Discrimination
If you experience or notice harassment, discrimination, or any of the unacceptable behaviors outlined herein at an Angular Seattle event, or have any other concerns, please report the incident as soon as possible. To report an incident, take one of the following actions: 
- inform the event organizer on site; 
- inform another organizer in your network; 
- report the incident to any Angular Seattle organizer by sending us a message on Meetup or Twitter at @ngSeattle.

We encourage you to report any incident of harassment, discrimination, or unacceptable behavior as soon as possible. Angular Seattle organizers will take all appropriate actions to mitigate risk factors moving forward and continue to provide a safe and secure environment for all Angular Seattle participants. Angular Seattle leadership is happy to assist attendees in contacting venue security, local law enforcement, or otherwise aid those experiencing harassment so that they feel safe for the duration of the event. The Angular Seattle organization team will take great care to ensure that the assistance provided meets the needs of attendees who were affected.
